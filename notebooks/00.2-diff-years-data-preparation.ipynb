    "> *The widespread adoption of digital payments has become increasingly important. In light of this, the aim of this project is to investigate the probability of an individual receiving digital wages in Africa. To achieve this, a series of empirical comparative assessments of machine learning classification algorithms will be conducted. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of these algorithms in predicting digital wage payments. Therefore, this notebook forms part of a larger project that seeks to explore the potential of machine learning in addressing issues related to financial inclusion in Africa.*"

    "* 2013\n",

For a few columns, this required mapping different names to the original data set, which we point out below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw data overview\n",
    "The data for this project includes data and metadata from surveys in Indonesia for the years 2011,m 2013, 2014. For each year, you will find:\n",
    "* The survey questionnaire(s)\n",
    "* Two Stata (version 14) data files: household and individual. These data contain a subset of the full survey dataset\n",
    "* An Excel file, providing a list of variables in the data files\n",
    "* Two text files (output of the “codebook” Stata command, providing a list of variables with some metadata.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Stata file contents\n",
    "The Stata data files contain:\n",
    "* The label variable (the binary variable to be predicted), named “poor”. This is just a poor/non-poor dummy variable. Note: poverty is calculated at the household level; either all or none of one same household member is/are poor.\n",
    "* The sample weights (the objective is to “predict” poverty taking into account these sample weights. Variable `wta_hh` contains the household weight; variable `wta_pop` contains the population weight (household weight * household size). These are probability weights (the sum of `wta_pop` gives us the extrapolated population of the country).\n",
    "* The file that will be used as training/test set is the `household.dta` file.\n",
    "* The `individual.dta` file contains variables on each household member. The file is provided to allow us to create additional variables to be added to the `household.dta` file. The variable `hhsize` (household size) is one such derived variable, already calculated. We will probably use this to generate new variables to possibly improve the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Consumable Feaures\n",
    "The `household.dta` file contains a series of variables whose name starts with `cons_`. These are variables derived from the expenditure module of the survey. It indicates whether a household consumed/purchased a specific item or not. Any reported value > 0 for an item was transformed into code 1; 0 otherwise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT*: Since one objective of this project is to design light survey questionnaires that would allow accurate poverty prediction, we want to be selective in the list of variables we use in the final model. What we would like to do is optimize a model using the variables we find useful (including new derived variables), under the constraint that no more than 50 of the `cons_` variables will be used. Some quick analysis of these `cons_` variables should make it possible to make a selection prior to tuning the models."
