# Digital-Wages
This is an AIMS Master's project done in collaboration with Global Centre on Digital Wages for Decent Work.

Digital wage payments have been shown to be a driver of both financial inclusion and financial health. While it has become the norm for people in developed economies to receive their wages digitally, this is not the prevailing situation in the majority of developing economies. Many workers in developing economies still receive their wages in cash, and of which a significant portion reside in Africa. In Africa, the majority of employment exists within the informal sector, where cash remains the dominant method of conducting transactions. The objective of this essay is to build a model that can predict the probability of individuals in Africa receiving digital wage payments. Additionally, it aims to identify the key factors that can predict the likelihood of individuals receiving their wages digitally.
