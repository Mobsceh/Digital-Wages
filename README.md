# Digital-Wages
This is an AIMS Master's project done in collaboration with Global Centre on Digital Wages for Decent Work.

The widespread adoption of digital payments has become increasingly important. In light of this, the aim of this project is to investigate the probability of an individual receiving digital wages in Africa. To achieve this, a series of empirical comparative assessments of machine learning classification algorithms will be conducted. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of these algorithms in predicting digital wage payments.
